This paper describes our participation in the \emph{Stance and Gender Detection in Tweets on Catalan Independence (StanceCat)} task at IberEval 2017.
During the searching process for the best classification system, we developed a comparative study over possible combination of corpus preprocessing, text representations and classification models. After an initial models exploration, we focus our attention over specific neural models and try to implement a new topology.
