This paper describes our participation in the \emph{Classification Of Spanish Election Tweets (COSET)} task at IberEval 2017.
During the searching process for the best classification system, we developed a comparative study over possible combination of corpus preprocessing, text representations and classification models. After an initial models exploration, we focus our attention over specific neural models.
Interesting insight can be drawn from the comparative study helping future practitioners tackling tweets classification problems to create system baseline for their work.
