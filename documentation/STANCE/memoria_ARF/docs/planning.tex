\chapter{Objectives planning} \label{chapter:planning}

In the following is shown the development cycle of the proposed approach. To do so, is presented a scheduling-timeline where the whole development is decomposed in objectives/milestone over a concrete timeline.


\section{Milestone}

For the best of our knowledge, we decomposed the proposed project thought the following milestones:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \label{ms:1} corpus processing module (preprocessing, filtering, features' extraction)
\item \label{ms:2} models' topology definition and implementation
\item \label{ms:3} models' training and evaluation automation
\item \label{ms:4} hyper-parameters' estimation automation
\item \label{ms:5} collection and presentation of the results
\end{enumerate}

\section{Timeline}

In the following, a scheduling table with the proposed dead line for each of the identified milestone is proposed.
