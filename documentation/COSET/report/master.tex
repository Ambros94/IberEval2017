% This is the master file of the folder structure.

% First, the preamble needs to be called. This contains all the 'under the hood' stuff for your document.
% Use \input rather than than \include for .tex files, because \input can be nested and don't include a page break.
\input{docs/preamble}

% The title page is created with the command \maketitle which needs to be placed after the \begin{document} command. To create the titlepage, some entries are needed: the name of the autor is defined by \author{}, the title by the entry \title{} and the date by the command \date{}. Note that the current date is displayed with \today.
\author{Luca Ambrosini \and Giancarlo Nicol\`{o}}
\title{ALC}
\date{}

%\authorrunning{<abbreviated author list>}
\institute{Univesitat Polit\`{e}cnica De Val\`{e}ncia}
%	\and <name of the next institute>}

% All the actual content of your document should be placed after \begin{document} and before \end{document}. This content should be placed in the docs folder and can then be called with \input{docs/filename}.
\begin{document}

% Here the actual title page is printed, based on the given entries \author{}, \title{} and \date{}.
\maketitle

% The table of contents can be automatically generated with the \tableofcontents command. Note that you need to compile the document twice in order to see the changes in the table of contents.

%\listoffigures
 
% List of tables
%\listoftables

% The list of algorithm
%\listofalgorithms

% The \input{} command reads and processes the indicated example.tex file. Note that docs/ locates the folder where the .tex file is stored.
