Version one

This paper describes an explorative approach to create from scratch a set of baselines for tackling tweet classification problems using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.
Our approach focuses on neural network models taken from state of the art that exploit different corpus preprocessing, tweets representations and features extraction methods.
Finally, we will discuss how we applied this methodology to the \emph{Classification Of Spanish Election Tweets (COSET)} task at IberEval 2017 and present the results we obtained

Version two

This paper describes our participation in the \emph{Classification Of Spanish Election Tweets (COSET)} task at IberEval 2017.
During the searching process for the best classification system to send for the competition, we developed a comparative study over possible combination of corpus preprocessing, text representations and classification models. After an initial models exploration, we focus our attention over specific neural models.
Interesting insight can be drawn from the comparative study helping future practitioner tackling tweets classification problems to create system baseline for their work.

Possible add for the report in general and 

handcrafted features

explain that we haven't put a proper module for handcrafted features, but our modular approach to solve the classification problem lead to an easy customization and integration of a proper module for these handcrafted features.
