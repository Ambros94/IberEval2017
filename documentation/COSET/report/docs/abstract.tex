This paper describes a methodology to create from scratch a set of baselines for tackling text classification problems using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

\emph{Here brief explanation of what we did}

Our approach focuses on neural network models taken from state of the art 

\emph{Example from Maite}
We used lexical information in the learning process. For those languages without lexicons, we automatically translated them, in order to be able to use this information. 

\emph{Part where we report where we used them}
Finally, we will discuss how we applied this methodology to the  Classification Of Spanish Election Tweets (COSET) task at IberEval 2017 and present the results we obtained
