This paper describes a methodology to create from scratch a set of baselines for tackling text classification problems using natural language processing and machine learning techniques.
Our approach focuses on neural network models taken from state of the art that exploit different corpus preprocessing, tweets representations and features extraction methods.
Finally, we will discuss how we applied this methodology to the \emph{Classification Of Spanish Election Tweets (COSET)} task at IberEval 2017 and present the results we obtained
