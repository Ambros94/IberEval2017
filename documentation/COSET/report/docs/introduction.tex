\section{Introduction} \label{sec:introduction}

Intro over nlp and text classification: motivation why this field is important and the actual challenge and open problems (will be top just to list some problem and their way to be solved, for example citing the different workshop that we had during the course)


Text classification is an important task in Natural Language Processing with many applications, such as web search, information retrieval, ranking and document classification (Deerwester et al., 1990; Pang and Lee, 2008). Recently, models based on neural networks have become increasingly popular (Kim, 2014; Zhang and LeCun, 2015; Conneau et al., 2016). While these models achieve very good performance in practice, they tend to be relatively slow both at train and test time, limiting their use on very large datasets.

Introduce informally our task and list some way of tackling this problem from the different perspectives, maybe say that we de-construct tthe actual approach and cathegorized their inner process in: representation, preprocessing, model and post processing (that we haven't done).

Finally explain how we structured this report

\subsection{INFO}

Average train sequence length: 135 chars (in chars)

Average train sequence length: 24 (in words)

Max train sequence length: 49 (words)

si Ã¨ ottimizzato il parametro del numero di parole da usare come input alla rete neurale, arrivando alla misura di 30

numeri superiore risultano in un eccesso di padding e perdita di informazione della rete. Numeri inferiori perdono troppa informazione
