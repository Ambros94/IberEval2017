\section{Task definition} \label{sec:task}

The COSET shared task aim was to classify Spanish written tweets talking about the 2015 Spanish General Election, where each tweet had to be classified into one of five different categories:
\begin{enumerate*}
\item political issues, related to the most abstract electoral confrontation; 
\item policy issues, about sectorial policies; 
\item personal issues, on the life and activities of the candidates; 
\item campaign issues, related with the evolution of the campaign;
\item and other issues.
\end{enumerate*}

In a first part of the task, participants had access to an initial corpus of labelled data used to start the investigation over possible combination of classification systems, then, two weeks before of the task deadline, a training and development set of labelled data was submitted to participant to benchmark their system.

Respect this last data set we analysed it and find the following statistical information (that guided us in the baselines building):
\begin{itemize}
	\item Average train sequence length:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 135 chars 
		\item 24 words
	\end{itemize}
	\item Max train sequence length: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 140 chars
		\item 49 words
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Average train sequence length:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 135 chars 
		\item 24 words
	\end{itemize}
	\item Max train sequence length: 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 140 chars
		\item 49 words
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}



\textbf{@ Luca: which one do you prefer? Multicolum or singular?}
