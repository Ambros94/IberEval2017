\section{Task definition} \label{sec:task}

The COSET shared task's \cite{gimenez2017overview} aim was to classify Spanish written tweets talking about the 2015 Spanish General Election, where each tweet had to be classified into one of five different categories:
\begin{enumerate*}
\item political issues, related to the most abstract electoral confrontation; 
\item policy issues, about sectorial policies; 
\item personal issues, on the life and activities of the candidates; 
\item campaign issues, related with the evolution of the campaign;
\item and other issues.
\end{enumerate*}


Participants had access to a labelled corpus composed of training set (2242 tweets) and development set (250 tweets) for system benchmarking. We analysed it and find the following statistical information presented in \cref{tab:corpus}.
