1) just put (via grid search) after word "optimization"
2) add to subsubsection word embedding "this choice was made after previous tries over other embeddings estimated from other corpus that lead to poor performance."
3) remove all the catalan citing and commented
4) change from "the complete architecture" -> "The architecture's idea"
5) LUCA
6) Ignorata perchè sta scritto nel kim's model
7) change of kernel
8) LUCA
9) two dense layer
10) [written after pre-processing observation]
From above observations, to continue our study and fix system's pre-processing pipeline, for each classification model we decided to use the combination of pre-processings that singularly applied give improvements to the system.
11) To not overwhelm reader of  verbose data, reported results are focused only over the two best performing model (Kim's model and FastText).
12) invented results
13) Ignored due to explanation inside the comparative study.
It's still missing the best configuration for each system, @Luca if you have it just
send them and I will write them ;)
