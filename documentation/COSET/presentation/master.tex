% This is the master file of the folder structure.

% First, the preamble needs to be called. This contains all the 'under the hood' stuff for your document.
% Use \input rather than than \include for .tex files, because \input can be nested and don't include a page break.
\input{docs/preamble}

% The title page is created with the command \maketitle which needs to be placed after the \begin{document} command. To create the titlepage, some entries are needed: the name of the autor is defined by \author{}, the title by the entry \title{} and the date by the command \date{}. Note that the current date is displayed with \today.
