State-of-the-art approaches to energy aware scheduling can be centralized or decentralized, predictive or reactive, and they can use methods ranging from optimal to heuristic. In this paper an agent-based distributed model is proposed for off-line scheduling in energy intensive manufacturing systems, by using a real industrial case, specifically manufacturing by injection moulding. A multi-objective scheduling problem requiring the minimization of the total job tardiness, total setup times and energy consumption is faced. The multi-agent approach is evaluated respect to its internal solving strategy (optimal or heuristic) and compared with a centralized approach. Advantages and drawbacks are pointed out for off-line energy-aware scheduling, giving useful reflection on how to face the field with new techniques.
